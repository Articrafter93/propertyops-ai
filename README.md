# PropertyOps AI

Executive dashboard for managing rooms-for-rent operations — covering the full lifecycle from applicant intake to deposit return — through a "control-room" interface over operational data.

> **Scope of this build (honest).** What is **built and running** is the **Next.js 16
> dashboard** on **static demonstration data** (`seed.json`) with **local mock authentication**
> via cookie. The multi-service automation layer (Make / Google Apps Script / WhatsApp / OpenAI /
> Drive) is the **target architecture design**, documented under `docs/`, but is **not implemented
> as live integrations** in this repository: in the demo, the "automations" are represented as
> seeded data (scenario monitor, error logs). All data is fictitious — this is a sandbox
> demonstration environment, not a production system.

## Stack (what's built)

| Layer | Technology | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Dashboard | Next.js 16 (App Router) · TypeScript · Tailwind v4 · shadcn/ui · Recharts | ✅ Implemented |
| Data | Static seed (`frontend/data/seed.json`, fixed date 2026-04-25) typed via `lib/seed.ts` | ✅ Implemented |
| Auth | Local mock via cookie (`lib/auth.ts`, gated by `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_AUTH`) | ✅ Implemented |
| Deployment | Vercel | 🎯 Target |

### Key technical decisions (the *why*)

- **Next.js 16 App Router + React Server Components** — data is read on the server and streamed as
  HTML, so the dashboard renders without shipping the dataset or a client data-fetching layer to the
  browser. Route groups (`(dashboard)`) share one authenticated shell without repeating layout code.
- **Static typed seed instead of a live database** — this build is a portfolio demonstration, so a
  real Postgres/Supabase instance would add operational cost (and free-tier pausing) with no benefit
  for an evaluator. The data is fully typed (`lib/types.ts`) and accessed through an async data layer
  (`lib/data.ts`), so swapping the seed for a real DB later is a single-layer change, not a rewrite.
- **Local mock auth over a real IdP** — role-based access (admin vs. maintenance technician) is
  enforced at a **real boundary** (Next.js middleware, `proxy.ts`), not just hidden in the UI. The
  mock is gated by `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_AUTH` so it can never ship enabled to a real production build.
- **Zero-dependency i18n (EN/ES)** — a cookie-based dictionary (`lib/i18n/`) with English as the
  default avoids pulling a full i18n framework for a two-locale toggle; formatters are locale-aware
  and `<html lang>` is set dynamically.

## Target architecture (design, not implemented in this build)

| Layer | Technology | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Orchestration | Make (Integromat) — 5 scenarios | 📐 Design (not built) |
| Business logic | Google Apps Script — 7 scripts | 📐 Design (not built) |
| Documents | Google Drive + Google Docs | 📐 Design (not built) |
| Communication | WhatsApp Business Cloud API | 📐 Design (not built) |
| AI | OpenAI GPT-4o (vision) + GPT-4o-mini (NLP) | 📐 Design (not built) |

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the proposed end-to-end design.

## Frontend dashboard (8 views, implemented)

Next.js 16 App Router, data from the typed static seed, "control-room" design (teal/petrol):

- **Executive dashboard** — KPIs, 30-day trend, activity feed
- **Onboarding Kanban** — lead pipeline with score and actions
- **Tenants** — table with individual file (payments, incidents, documents)
- **Rooms** — grid by property + per-room inventory
- **Incidents** — real-time SLA traffic-light, filters, row expansion
- **Checkout** — 4-step wizard (notice → inspection → charges → close)
- **Inspections** — before/after slider, AI-score donut, charges table
- **Automations** — scenario monitor (simulated data) + error log

## Run locally

```bash
cd frontend
npm install && npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

Requires a single variable in `frontend/.env.local` (see `frontend/.env.example`) to enable the
local mock demo login:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_AUTH=enabled
```

Demo accounts (password pre-filled `Demo1234!`): `admin@propertyops.demo` (admin → `/dashboard`),
`tecnico@propertyops.demo` (technician → `/incidents`).

## Documentation

- [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — **target** end-to-end architecture design (not implemented in this build).
- [docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md) — conceptual data model (16 entities); the demo implements a subset as static data in `seed.json`.
